1.To check each prototype change the respective component in the render() in index.js file.

2. I have created a dummy box of solid color to mimic the "New Strategies" editor box, just for the sake of protoype.

Proto 1: "New Stratgies" is position beside the right side of the table, if normal behaviour is needed, change the value of "responsiveValue" variable to "standard", if responsive behaviour is desired, change its value to "simple".
"responsiveValue" variable is defined at line no. 27 in Proto1 file.

Proto 2: "New Strategies" is positioned above the table.(size of the table is fixed using the native-options of mui-datatables)

Proto 3: Popup opens whenever any icon of second column is clicked.(position of the popup can be adjusted as needed)
